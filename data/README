These folders contain the data files.

work/
  - where the collector writes all of its data to. It will
    write to a file named collection.txt

process/
  - where the Mover will move collection.txt to when it is
    awaiting processing.

    1. When collection.txt > 100MB
    2. When the timestamp of the first record is > 30minutes

  - work/collection.txt will be moved to process/collection-{ts}.txt
    where timestamp is the time when the file was moved.

  - files in here will be bzip2 compressed and put into
    the relocate/ directory.

relocate/

  - files here are ready to be relocated to amazon S3 for 
    final storage.

  - files will be renamed once again when moved to S3 to
    collection-{start ts}-{end ts}-{machineId}.bz2

  - {start ts}   - timestamp of first record in collection
  - {end ts}     - timestamp of last record in collection
  - {machine id} - my MAC address, for distributed collection

trash/
  - files are moved here after they've been copied to S3

  - scheduled garbage collector will come by and delete
    these files.
