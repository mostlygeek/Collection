Was for delayed writes w/ beanstalk but
the overhead was actually quite high.

Better to just have PHP write straight to the collection.txt
file and use kernel based file locking to prevent concurrent
writers crushing each other.

It was almost 50% (pheanstalk) to 90% Socket_Beanstalk slower
using beanstalk in the middle.

For this use case, no beanstalk. PHP -> file is fastest.
